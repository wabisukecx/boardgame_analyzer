description: The sequel to Scythe sends players on a new adventure into Siberia, where
  a massive meteorite crashed near the Tunguska River, awakening ancient corruption.
  An expedition led by Dr. Tarkovsky ventures into the taiga to learn about the meteorite
  and its impact on the land. Itching for adventure, heroes from the war privately
  fund their own expeditions to Siberia, hoping to find artifacts, overcome challenges,
  and ultimately achieve glory. Expeditions has completely different mechanisms than
  Scythe, though the goal was to capture some of the same feelings that Scythe evokes,
  with a slightly darker, more supernatural theme.&#10;&#10;Expeditions is a competitive,
  card-driven, engine-building game of exploration. Play cards to gain power, guile,
  and unique worker abilities; move your mech to mysterious locations and gain cards
  found among the tiles; use workers, items, meteorites, and quests to enhance your
  mech; and use power and guile to vanquish corruption.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
