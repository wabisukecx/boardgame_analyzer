description: In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in
  rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meagre vineyards. They have a few
  plots of land, an old crush pad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have
  a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&#10;&#10;The players
  are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout
  the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different
  tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those
  tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent
  workers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries,
  and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around
  the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them.
  Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful. Using those
  workers and visitors, the vineyard owners can expand their vineyards by building
  structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders, working towards the goal of
  running the most successful winery in Tuscany.&#10;&#10;Viticulture Essential Edition
  includes the base game of Viticulture and a few of the most popular modules from
  the original Tuscany expansion, including Mamas &amp; Papas, Fields (previously
  known as Properties), expanded and revised Visitors, and Automa cards for a solo
  variant, along with a few minor rule changes.&#10;&#10;
