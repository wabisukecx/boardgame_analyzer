description: Architects of the West Kingdom is set at the end of the Carolingian Empire,
  circa 850 AD. As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain
  their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed
  domain. Players need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and keep a watchful
  eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times, and rival architects will stop
  at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company
  of thieves and black marketeers?&#10;&#10;The aim of Architects of the West Kingdom
  is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are
  gained by constructing various buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's
  cathedral. Throughout the game, players need to make a lot of moral decisions. However,
  only at game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhand deals here and there
  might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends
  once a set number of constructions have been completed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
