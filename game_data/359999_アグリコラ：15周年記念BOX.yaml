description: 'Agricola 15 celebrates the 15th anniversary of Uwe Rosenberg''s Agricola
  by packing a lot of material created since the game''s debut into a single XXL box:
  the revised edition of the Agricola base game, the complete Artifex and Bubulcus
  expansion decks, promo items that were previously long gone (adapted to go with
  the revised edition), some novelties (and no, you don''t have all the L-Deck cards
  yet...), and a well-organized inlay for quick set-up and storage.&#10;&#10;In total,
  Agricola 15 contains 430 cards, more than 200 tokens, and more than 270 wooden components.
  This set is compatible with both the Farmers of the Moor expansion and the expansion
  for five and six players.&#10;&#10;'
