description: 'An incredible new dinosaur graveyard has been discovered, and if the
  early findings are any indication, it could be a treasure trove of fossils and bones
  like the world has never seen! In Fossilis, 2 to 5 players become paleontologists
  working the dig site with shovels, whisk brooms, and chisels looking for a find
  that could make their career.&#10;&#10;Each round, players get two actions to dig
  at the site or make an extraction. As they remove the top layers of sand, clay,
  and stone, they''ll discover trace fossils, which can be exchanged for tools, the
  plaster necessary to extract bones, and discovery points. As they delve deeper,
  precious bones will be exposed. They can make a careful extraction if they have
  the right amount of plaster, but sometimes shifting the earth to cover up a find
  and slow down the competition is the right move. Bones on their own can be valuable,
  but museums are really interested in more complete specimens. Sets of bones can
  be exchanged for museum cards worth big points!&#10;&#10;Fossilis features a unique
  3D dig site board, with recessed pockets filled with dinosaur bones, and thick,
  chunky terrain tiles that cover the dig site. Players have to use strategy, timing,
  and a little bit of luck if they want to make the best discoveries, get their name
  in all the paleontology journals, and of course, win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
