description: Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent
  world of shifting motives. Players will take on the roles of wandering adventurers
  with their own special sets of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this
  dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out
  menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities
  with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand
  an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&#10; This is a game with
  a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions.
  After a scenario, players will make decisions about what to do next, which will
  determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo;
  book. Playing through a scenario is a co-operative affair where players will fight
  against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order
  of play and what a player does on their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses
  two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their
  initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it
  is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use
  the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players
  must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from
  their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted
  and be forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;
