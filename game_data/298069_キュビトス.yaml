description: Be fast or be last!&#10;&#10;In Cubitos, players take on the role of
  participants in the annual Cube Cup, a race of strategy and luck to determine the
  Cubitos Champion. Each player has a runner on the racetrack and a support team,
  which is represented by all the dice you roll. Each turn, you roll dice and use
  their results to move along the racetrack, buy new dice, and use abilities &mdash;
  but you must be careful not to push your luck rolling too much or you could bust!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
