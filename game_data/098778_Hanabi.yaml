description: Hanabi&mdash;named for the Japanese word for &quot;fireworks&quot;&mdash;is
  a cooperative game in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by
  placing the cards on the table in the right order. (In Japanese, hanabi is written
  as &#232;&#138;&#177;&#231;&#129;&#171;; these are the ideograms flower and fire,
  respectively.)&#10;&#10;The card deck consists of five different colors of cards,
  numbered 1&ndash;5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row
  in the correct order from 1&ndash;5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in
  this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players. To
  assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers
  or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to
  finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.&#10;&#10;An extra suit
  of cards, rainbow colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play.&#10;&#10;Hanabi
  was originally published as part of Hanabi & Ikebana.&#10;&#10;
