description: Tails on Fire is an interactive card game in which the ever-changing
  selection of the best three playing cards for a round leads to a permanent dilemma.&#10;&#10;At
  the start of a round, players choose only 3 cards out of up to 10 to use this round.
  On their turn they can either play a card exactly 1 higher than the last or pass.
  If your card is still on top of the playing pile when your turn comes around again,
  then you win the round and take a fire card and sometimes steal some more from others.&#10;&#10;At
  the end of the game, the player with the most flames wins!&#10;&#10;
