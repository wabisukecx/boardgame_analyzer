description: In Forest Shuffle, players compete to gather the most valuable trees,
  then attract species to these trees, thus creating an ecologically balanced habitat
  for flora and fauna.&#10;&#10;To start, each player has six cards in hand, with
  cards depicting either a particular type of tree or two forest dwellers (animal,
  plant, mushroom, etc.), with these latter cards being divided in half, whether vertically
  or horizontally, with one dweller in each card half.&#10;&#10;On a turn, either
  draw two cards &mdash; whether face down from the deck or face up from the clearing
  &mdash; and add them to your hand, or play a card from your hand by paying the cost,
  then putting it into play.&#10;&#10;During set-up, three winter cards were placed
  into the bottom third of the deck. When the third winter card is drawn, the game
  ends immediately, then players tally their points based on the trees and dwellers
  in their forest. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Forest Shuffle is
  the first in a line of Lookout games sporting the Lookout Greenline label, produced
  on FSC certified paper and avoiding plastic completely.&#10;&#10;
