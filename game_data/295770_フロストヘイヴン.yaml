description: 'Frosthaven is the story of a small outpost far to the north of the capital
  city of White Oak.  It''s an outpost barely surviving the harsh weather let alone
  invasions from forces both known and unknown. However, a group of mercenaries, at
  the end of their rope, will help bring this settlement back from the edge of destruction.
  Not only will they have to deal with the harsh elements, but with other, far more
  dangerous threats out in the unforgiving cold, as well. There are: Algox, the bigger,
  more yeti-like cousins of the Inox, attacking from the mountains; Lurkers flooding
  in from the northern sea; and rumors have it that there are machines that wander
  the frozen wastes of their own free will. The party of mercenaries must face all
  of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they
  can work together against even more sinister forces.&#10;&#10;Frosthaven is a standalone
  adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new
  characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred
  new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign.  Characters and items from Gloomhaven
  will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.&#10;&#10;In addition to using the
  well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven features other elements,
  such as mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player
  control over how the ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering
  new ways to progress.&#10;&#10;Frosthaven has a whole new set of items but there
  is a mechanism for bringing items over from ''Gloomhaven''. However, as Frosthaven''s
  outpost is a remote location, these products may be imported but are not present
  as standard items. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items
  through a crafting system rather than just buying them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
