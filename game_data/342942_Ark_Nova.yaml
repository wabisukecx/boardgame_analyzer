  zoo. With the ultimate goal of owning the most successful zoological establishment,
  you will build enclosures, accommodate animals, and support conservation projects
  all over the world. Specialists and unique buildings will help you in achieving
  this goal.&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of five action cards to manage their gameplay,
  and the power of an action is determined by the slot the card currently occupies.
