  zoo. With the ultimate goal of owning the most successful zoological establishment,
  you will build enclosures, accommodate animals, and support conservation projects
  all over the world. Specialists and unique buildings will help you in achieving
  this goal.&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of five action cards to manage their gameplay,
  and the power of an action is determined by the slot the card currently occupies.
  The cards in question are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    CARDS: Allows you to gain new zoo cards
  (animals, sponsors, and conservation project cards).&#10;    BUILD: Allows you to

  workers to carry out different tasks.&#10;    SPONSORS: Allows you to play a sponsor
  card in your zoo or to raise money.&#10;&#10;&#10;255 cards featuring animals, specialists,
  special enclosures, and conservation projects, each with a special ability, are
