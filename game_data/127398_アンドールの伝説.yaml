description: Legends of Andor is a cooperative adventure board game for two to four
  players in which a band of heroes must work together to defend a fantasy realm from
  invading hordes. To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous
  quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created
  by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the
  march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.&#10;&#10;At
  the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which
  tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each
  scenario, or &quot;Legend&quot;, a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding
  tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along
  the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw
  of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement
  of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of
  Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy
  tale.&#10;&#10;Will their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of
  glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm? Uncover epic tales of glory
  as you live the Legends of Andor!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
