description: 'Welcome to the Urban Development Department!&#10;&#10;This is Vientole
  City, a beautiful place with vast flower fields, lush hills, and historic buildings.
  The market is bustling with people. As the leader of the city''s development project,
  you will strive to improve the lives of the citizens. You''ll plan public works,
  prioritize citizens'' well-being, and create a balanced urban environment. Your
  excellent leadership and wisdom will greatly impact the growth of Vientole City.  Now,
  let''s make this city an attractive and livable place with your hands!&#10;&#10;The
  game consists of 4 rounds. Each round is divided into three phases: Planning Phase,
  Placement Phase, and Confirmation Phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;     During the Planning
  Phase, players draft prepared land tiles.&#10;     In the Placement Phase, players
  place the drafted land tiles onto their city boards. The key point is that the tiles
  are placed in reverse order of the drafting sequence.&#10;     During the Confirmation
  Phase, players check the completion of milestone cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;This sequence
  is repeated for 4 rounds, and in the end, each player will have placed 16 land tiles
  on their city boards. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
