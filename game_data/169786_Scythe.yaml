description: It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great
  war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The
  Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its
  doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an
  engine-building game set in a 1920s era, alternate-history. It is a time of farming
  and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player
  controls one of five factions of Eastern Europe, all of which are attempting to
  earn their fortunes and claim their stakes in the land around the mysterious Factory.
  Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers,
  build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the
  game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different
  starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated
  to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of
  the game (each faction always starts in the same place). Scythe uses a streamlined
  action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk
  pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict
  for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players
  almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual
  hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo;
  cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored
  lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them
  to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven
  by choices, not luck or randomness. Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building
  to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that
  improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities,
  activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap
  greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create
  a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players
  improve their engines adds to the unique feel of each game, even if having played
  one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;
