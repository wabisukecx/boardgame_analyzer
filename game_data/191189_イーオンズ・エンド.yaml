description: 'The survivors of a long-ago invasion have taken refuge in the forgotten
  underground city of Gravehold. There, the desperate remnants of society have learned
  that the energy of the very breaches the beings use to attack them can be repurposed
  through various gems, transforming the malign energies within into beneficial spells
  and weapons to aid their last line of defense: the breach mages.&#10;&#10;Aeon''s
  End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of
  innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the
  chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that require careful planning with
  every discarded card. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless
  and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly
  of all, their collective wits.&#10;&#10;'
