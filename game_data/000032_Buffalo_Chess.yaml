description: In Buffalo Chess, a.k.a. Bison, one player represents Indians who are
  trying to keep the village from being overrun by buffalo. This player moves the
  Indian chief and his dogs while the other player takes charge of the herd of rampaging
  buffalo, all of which are represented by wooden pieces. Each side has its own style
  of play as the pieces move differently.&#10;&#10;
