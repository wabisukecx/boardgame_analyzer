description: Viscounts of the West Kingdom is set at a time when the King&rsquo;s
  reign began to decline, circa 980 AD. Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong
  King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes. But peace
  is a tenuous affair. As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to
  lead and sought independence from the crown. Since finding favour in his courts,
  our future has also become uncertain. As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive.
  Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority,
  should there be a sudden shift in power.&#10;&#10;The aim of Viscounts of the West
  Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points
  are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle
  and acquiring deeds for new land. Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but
  should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours. Each
  turn they will be travelling around the kingdom, looking to increase their influence
  among the various areas of society. The game ends once the Kingdom reaches poverty
  or prosperity - or potentially both!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
