description: 'Once hungry Kitty craved to eat, but sadly found no yummy meat, instead
  just found some weird spice, scoffed it down and paid the price. From prickling
  hot sensation came the grand idea for this sweet game.&#10;&#10;Sweet &amp; Spicy
  is a bluffing card game for 2-6 players and the kid-friendly variant of Spicy. Instead
  of Wasabi you can now play with Lemon and there is a new card in the game: The SUPER-JOKER.
  But the game principle remains the same.&#10;&#10;Just like in Spicy, the cards
  are played face down, so you can cheat when you announce your card. But it''s not
  just about bluffing convincingly. You can almost always play a card that is at least
  half right if you play it skillfully from your hand. It''s a matter of tactically
  considering which card you can get away with: Do I play a &quot;pepper 9&quot; better
  than a &quot;chili 10&quot; or a suit joker than a &quot;pepper 10&quot;? Or do
  I pass better, because I''m sure it will be noticeable that I''ve been thinking
  about it for so long?&#10;&#10;In Sweet &amp; Spicy, the super joker is added, which
  can be any spice and any number. It is therefore always correct and cannot be doubted.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
