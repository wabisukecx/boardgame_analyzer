description: In Only One Collection, players are collecting cards hoping to have the
  most of each type, and the player on their right to have the second most!&#10;&#10;On
  their turn a player can either add a card from the deck to a set on the table or
  take a set.  A player cannot add a duplicate number to a set.&#10;&#10;The game
  ends when a certain card is revealed in the deck.  Then, the player who has the
  most cards of each number earns 1 point and then earns 1 point per card of those
  numbers held by the player on their right.&#10;&#10;The person with the most points
  wins.&#10;&#10;
