description: 'For an age, the tower lay in ruins. Unbeknownst to the people of the
  realm, a great evil stirred in its bowels. It started with strange sightings: a
  flock of crows flying in circles until they dropped from the sky, the lake frozen
  solid in the height of summer. In time, they could not deny that which they most
  feared.&#10;&#10;The evil had not been vanquished. The darkness would soon fall
  again. The tower will rise.&#10;&#10;A &quot;sequel&quot; to the 1981 grail game,
  Return to Dark Tower is a game for 1-4 players who take the role of heroes. Together,
  they gather resources, cleanse buildings, defeat monsters, and undertake quests
  to build up their strength and discern what foe ultimately awaits them. When the
  heroes face the tower, the game shifts into its dramatic second act, where the players
  have one chance to defeat the enemy once and for all.&#10;&#10;The game features
  both cooperative and competitive modes of play.&#10;&#10;The game features traditional
  game mechanisms, such as engine building and resource management, paired with a
  technological interface unlike any seen before in games, including the titular tower,
  which holds more than a few secrets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;'
