description: The expedition to the Western Lands is the kind of honor that comes once
  in a lifetime for a royal cartographer. But these are dangerous times. War ravages
  the land, and you are sure to encounter Dragul forces determined to thwart Queen
  Gimnax&rsquo;s plans for western expansion.&#10;&#10;Fortunately, brave heroes have
  risen to the defense of Nalos. Chart their deeds alongside the queen's edicts and
  secure your place in history.&#10;&#10;Cartographers Heroes is the sequel to the
  critically acclaimed map-drawing game Cartographers. It includes all-new map sheets,
  scoring cards, explore cards, and ambush cards with unique abilities.&#10;&#10;Cartographers
  Heroes can be played on its own or mixed with components from the original game
  for a greater variety of gameplay possibilities.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;
