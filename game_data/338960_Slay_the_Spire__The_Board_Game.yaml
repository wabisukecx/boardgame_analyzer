description: 'Slay the Spire: The Board Game is a co-operative deck-building, dungeon-crawling
  adventure. Craft a unique deck, encounter bizarre creatures, discover relics of
  immense power, and finally become strong enough to slay the Spire!&#10;&#10;Each
  player starts with a character with unique abilities and a simple deck of cards
  that they can improve by adding and removing cards during the game. Slay the Spire
  is also a rogue-like. That means that when you die (and you will die!), start over
  from the beginning. Take the lessons you learned and try again!&#10;&#10;The game
  is divided into Acts. At the end of an Act you can continue, stop and end the adventure
  there, or save and continue another time!&#10;&#10;If players defeat the final Boss,
  they win the game! Which Boss you consider to be final depends on how many Acts
  you want to play. You can stop playing at the end of any Act! When a player&rsquo;s
  HP is reduced to 0, they are dead and the party loses the game.&#10;&#10;'
