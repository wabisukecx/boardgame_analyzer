description: 'In Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West, players embark on twelve
  journeys across North America as 19th century pioneers. The campaign begins on the
  East Coast, with players working their way to the West from one adventure to the
  next, meeting challenges along the way. As in Ticket to Ride, completing your tickets
  will remain your primary goal, but you will need to develop other skills if you
  hope to overcome the unexpected events and your resourceful rivals. Game after game,
  route after route, you will continuously fill your vault with earnings. As the story
  progresses, you will open frontier boxes that unlock new rules, content, and many
  more surprises.&#10;&#10;In the Legacy style, Legends of the West is a unique experience
  molded by player choices. Each player has their own role to play, allowing them
  to change the way the story unfolds around them. Combined with evolving mechanisms
  that change as the game progresses, players will have a new experience every time
  they gather around the board.&#10;&#10;At the end of the twelve games in this legacy
  campaign, you will have transformed your game into a unique copy that you can continue
  playing for a lifetime..&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;'
