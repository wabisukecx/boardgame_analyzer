description: So Clover! is a cooperative word-association game. Play as a team to
  get the highest score. Get Keywords and secretly write their common features on
  your Clover board; these are your Clues. Then work together to try to figure out
  each player&rsquo;s Keywords. At the end of the game, add up your score according
  to how many Keywords you found and write it in the Record of Legends. Try to beat
  your high score each game!&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
