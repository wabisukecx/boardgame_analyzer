description: '7 Wonders&#10;The board game with more awards than any other game on
  the planet.&#10;With over 30 international awards, and over a million copies sold
  throughout the world, rediscover 7 Wonders, the game which has won more awards than
  any other game in the world, in a whole new version.   Lauded by both the public
  and critics, 7 Wonders has claimed its place as an unmissable reference point in
  modern board gaming. 7 Wonders is based on a simple and elegant mechanic (drafting)
  which allows up to 7 players to play with no dead time. Players make their choice
  and apply all of them at the same time. These choices are varied and their impact
  is real. Finally, the game is divided into 3 Ages which little by little increase
  the importance of these choices and thus the tension in the game. The global mechanics
  and the care given to the artwork are used to immerse the player in Antiquity and
  have contributed to the game&rsquo;s success.&#10;A game plays out over 3 rounds,
  called Ages, during which you simultaneously play cards, one at a time, to develop
  your City.&#10;&#10;These cards represent the various Buildings you can construct:
  resource producers, civilian, commercial, military, scientific structures, and guilds.&#10;&#10;At
  the end of each Age, you go to war with your nearest neighbours. At the end of all
  3 Ages, you tally up all of the victory points earned by your City, your wonder,
  your military prowess, and your treasury. The player with the highest score wins
  the game.&#10;&#10;Content:&#10;7 Wonder boards&#10;148 Age cards: 49 Age I cards,
  49 Age II cards, and 50 Age III cards&#10;78 Coins: 54 Coins of value 1, and 24
