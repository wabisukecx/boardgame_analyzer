description: 'Based on simple and intuitive hand management, Heat: Pedal to the Metal
  puts players in the driver''s seat of intense car races, jockeying for position
  to cross the finish line first, while managing their car''s speed if they don''t
  want to overheat. Selecting the right upgrades for their car will help them hug
  the curves and keep their engine cool enough to maintain top speeds. Ultimately,
  their driving skills will be the key to victory!&#10;&#10;Drivers can compete in
  a single race or use the &quot;Championship System&quot; to play a whole season
  in one game night, customizing their car before each race to claim the top spot
  of the podium. They have to be careful as the weather, road conditions, and events
  will change every race to spice up their championship. Players can also enjoy a
  solo mode with the Legends Module or add automated drivers as additional opponents
  in multiplayer games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;'
