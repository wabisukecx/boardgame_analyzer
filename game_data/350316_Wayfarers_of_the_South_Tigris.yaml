description: Wayfarers of the South Tigris is set during the height of the Abbasid
  Caliphate, circa 820 AD. As brave explorers, cartographers and astronomers, players
  set off from Baghdad to map the surrounding land, waterways, and heavens above.
  Players must carefully manage their caravan of workers and equipment, while reporting
  back regularly to journal their findings at the House of Wisdom. Will you succeed
  in impressing the Caliph, or lose your way and succumb to the wilderness?&#10;&#10;The
  aim of Wayfarers of the South Tigris is to be the player with the most victory points
  (VP) at the game's end. Points are primarily gained by mapping the land, water,
  and sky. Players can also gain points from upgrading their caravans, by gaining
  inspiration from nobles, and by influencing the three guilds of science, trade and
  exploration. As they make discoveries, players will want to quickly journal their
  progress. The game ends once one player&rsquo;s marker has reached the far right
  column of the journal track.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
