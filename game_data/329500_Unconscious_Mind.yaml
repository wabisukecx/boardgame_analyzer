description: In the early 1900s, the Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud established
  a revolutionary theory called psychoanalysis, related to the study of the unconscious
  mind. As his work took hold, supporters met at Freud's apartment every Wednesday
  to discuss psychology and dream symbolism. This group&mdash;the Wednesday Psychological
  Society&mdash;marked the beginning of the worldwide psychoanalytic movement. As
  a member of this society, you aim to formulate new therapeutic techniques, establish
  a practice, grow your clientele, and become Freud&rsquo;s most distinguished contemporary.
  To best accomplish this, you&rsquo;ll need to share insights, discuss ideas with
  peers, and publish theories. And to stay invigorated, you&rsquo;ll likely need some
  coffee&mdash;lots of coffee.&#10;&#10;Unconscious Mind is a euro-style game featuring
  worker placement, engine building, multiple rondels, and cascading effects. On your
  turn, you may place one or two Ideas (workers) on a central Meeting Table to access
  a variety of actions, such as adding tiles to your player board, drafting and playing
  cards, and moving around the city of Vienna. Where you place your Ideas also determines
  how far to advance your rondel&rsquo;s inkpot, activating a row or column of tile
  effects on your player board.&#10;&#10;To treat your clients and interpret their
  dreams, you must work with a supply of Insight resources, which you&rsquo;ll manage
  on a multi-level dial. As you work through surface-level Manifest dreams into deep-seated
  Latent dreams, these Insights will help your clients reach catharsis. This is represented
  by lifting transparent layers from the client cards&mdash;unlocking their ongoing
  special abilities and end-game scoring opportunities.&#10;&#10;Once the group has
  solidified its reputation, the end of the game is signaled, and the member with
  the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
