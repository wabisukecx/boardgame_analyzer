description: In Wriggle Roulette, players take turns reaching into a bag filled with
  eel- and snake-shaped wooden pieces, trying to pull out as many eels as possible
  &mdash; but if the number of snakes grabbed by all players exceeds the limit, a
  &quot;snake outbreak&quot; occurs, and the player who grabbed the most pieces loses
  all of their eels.&#10;&#10;You want to grab more than everyone else to score big,
  yet a snake outbreak would be devastating. Will you grab a bunch? Just a few? Or
  back out entirely? Read your opponents' expressions and control your own greed to
  make the right call.&#10;&#10;
