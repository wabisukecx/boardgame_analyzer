description: 'In Gold West, players compete as prospectors building their mining empires
  while vying over the precious metals of the frontier. In a delicate balance of resource
  management and area control, players must plan their building strategies while carefully
  managing their supply tracks to refine the right resources at the most opportune
  times. Stay a step ahead of the competition and you could lead the West into the
  Golden Age.&#10;&#10;The goal of Gold West is to accumulate the most victory points
  through clever management of your growing mining empire. There are five resources
  in the game: the metals Copper, Silver, and Gold are used to acquire victory points
  in a variety of ways, while Timber and Stone are building materials used to build
  camps and settlements on the board to collect more resources and influence the landscape.&#10;&#10;Each
  hex contains either two or three resources. Gold generally earns players the most
  points, with silver and copper yielding slightly less. In addition, each terrain
  type scores points for the player with the most influence therein at the end of
  the game. Copper terrains are the most valuable, with Silver, Gold, and Forest Terrains
  earning slightly fewer points.&#10;&#10;When gaining new metals and materials, players
  place them in their &quot;supply track&quot;, a mancala-style track in which you
  will manage your resources. You get points the further back in the track you place
  them, as this creates a more refined product, but it will take longer to get these
  resources to the front of the supply track where they can be used. Shipping, investments,
  and Boomtown offices often reward players who fulfill them earlier, so it''s a careful
  balance of risk and reward.&#10;&#10;'
