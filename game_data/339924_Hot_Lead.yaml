description: Lead the undercover investigation against five criminal groups to gather
  enough evidence to convict them. However, if you investigate too aggressively, the
  criminals will smell a rat and go dark!&#10;&#10;In each round of Hot Lead, criminal
  cards are displayed in a column equal to the number of players. Players then make
  their bid by simultaneously revealing an investigator card from their hand. The
  highest investigator bid takes the criminal card closest to the deck, the second
  highest takes the second closest, and so on. These cards are worth points equal
  to their face value (0-5).&#10;&#10;Gather enough evidence on one criminal organization
  to convict them when the game concludes after ten rounds; in game terms, by having
  exactly three of a suit, you earn 10 bonus points. Ten bonus points are also awarded
  to those who acquire criminal cards of all five suits. If you investigate too aggressively
  and grab the fourth card of a suit, those criminals will sense a rat and you'll
  scare them underground, thereby losing all of those cards. The player with the most
  points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;
