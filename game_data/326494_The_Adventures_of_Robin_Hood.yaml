description: In England in 1193, the county of Nottinghamshire suffers under the yoke
  of evil Prince John and his henchmen. Can Robin Hood and his companions escape the
  sheriff's guards and complete their adventures successfully?&#10;&#10;In The Adventures
  of Robin Hood, players take on the role of Robin Hood and his companions, with the
  action taking place on a living game board with no set paths. The board changes
  over the course of each adventure, and the movement of the characters is handled
  via an innovative mechanism that uses different length wooden character pieces.
  Various actions and secrets are integrated into the game levels and are revealed
  only in the course of the story. The game board &quot;remembers&quot; what players
  have already explored or found, and thanks to the special materials, the entire
  game can be set up and dismantled quickly.&#10;&#10;Instead of using cards as in
  the author's Legends of Andor, the game tells the story of Robin Hood in a high-quality
  hardcover book, and depending on the decisions the players make, the story changes...&#10;&#10;
