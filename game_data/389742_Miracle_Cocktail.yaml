  - Miracle Cocktail, players opened each their own bar in a city renown for its magical
  cocktails. They will compete to become the most popular bar in town, by obtaining
  the most popularity points.&#10;&#10;Each round, magical ingredients are poured
  one next to the other from a magical cocktail shaker. Players will then have to
  choose a group of 3 contiguous ingredients, which will fill different storage bottles
  or even generate coins, depending on their amount and nature. Storing enough of
  these components or using them to create cocktail recipes will generate special
  actions, additional ingredients, coins, and popularity. Combos can be created in
  the process.&#10;&#10;After 8 rounds, popularity points are tallied for every player
  and whoever has the most wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;
