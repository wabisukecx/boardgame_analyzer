description: 'In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters
  they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends
  at the close of a round in which a player erects their seventh building. Players
  then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players
  start the game with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in
  five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the
  other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters.
  At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards
  one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to
  the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character
  has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation,
  and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical
  order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing
  all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another
  player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On
  a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards
  one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect
  this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each
  building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings,
  at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or
  buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The 2016 edition of Citadels includes twenty-seven
  characters &mdash; eight from the original Citadels, ten from the Dark City expansion,
  and nine new ones &mdash; along with thirty unique building districts, and the rulebook
  includes six preset lists of characters and districts beyond the starter list, each
  crafted to encourage a different style and intensity of gameplay.&#10;&#10;'
