description: 'Within the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering
  trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters
  is thriving and expanding. From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and
  gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established.
  You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There
  are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host&mdash;you
  have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before
  the winter moon rises?&#10;&#10;Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and
  worker placement.&#10;&#10;On their turn a player can take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;a)
  Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed
  on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various
  actions to further the development of a player''s tableau: gathering resources,
  drawing cards, and taking other special actions.&#10;&#10;b) Play a Card: Each player
  is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter
  cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance,
  and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant
  abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous
  strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.&#10;&#10;c) Prepare for
  the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are
  added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter,
  at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;'
