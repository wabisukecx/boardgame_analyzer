description: In the dystopic 1930s, the industrial revolution pushed the exploitation
  of fossil-based resources to the limit, and now the only thing powerful enough to
  quench the thirst for power of the massive machines and of the unstoppable engineering
  progress is the unlimited hydroelectric energy provided by the rivers.&#10;&#10;Barrage
  is a resource management strategic game in which players compete to build their
  majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity, and deliver all the
  potential power through pressure tunnels connected to the energy turbines of their
  powerhouses.&#10;&#10;Each player represents one of the four international companies
  who are gathering machinery, innovative patents and brilliant engineers to claim
  the best locations to collect and exploit the water of a contested Alpine region
  crossed by rivers.&#10;&#10;Over five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements
  represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal
  contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt
  to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions
  and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing
  strategy.&#10;&#10;
