description: When all you can identify in the horizon for many long days is the line
  that detaches the sea from the sky, the glimpse of a distant shore appearing before
  you will make you shiver at the understanding that the adventure is about to begin.&#10;&#10;You
  find yourself astonished, landing on the shore that will be the origin of an extensive
  exploration through the Galapagos, a magic place of inconceivable beauty and endless
  biodiversity. There, you will gather repertoires and expand your knowledge of the
  natural sciences. Your eyes will learn how to detect the hidden species in the tropical
  forest, gazing at the countless colors and textures of nature. After inspiring hours
  spent studying and getting to enlightening conclusions, you will rest under a sparkling
  sky, admiring the stunning complexity of the animal realm.&#10;&#10;Darwin's Journey
  is a worker-placement Eurogame in which players recall Charles Darwin's memories
  of his adventure through the Galapagos islands, which contributed to the development
  of his theory of evolution.&#10;&#10;With the game's innovative worker progression
  system, each worker will have to study the disciplines that are a prerequisite to
  perform several actions in the game, such as exploration, correspondence, gathering,
  and dispatch of repertoires found on the island to museums in order to contribute
  to the human knowledge of biology. The game lasts five rounds, and thanks to several
  short- and long-term objectives, every action you take will grant victory points
  in different ways.&#10;&#10;
