description: Magic Number Eleven is an innovative sports game depicting the tactical
  confrontation of football games with simple rules. &#10;It's a 2 player game, and
  each player becomes a coach of a football team, confronting each other. The game
  consists of two Rounds; 1st half and 2nd half. Each round consists of several turns.&#10;&#10;In
  your turn, you basically place a Player Card on the Field Board. The meaning of
  Player Card placement is an expression of where the team is currently focused on
  and which player is the center of the tactics. &#10;Each Player Card has semicircular
  tactical icons which can be combined with the icons on other Player Cards. Therefore,
  each team will have more tactical icons according to the combination of the Player
  Cards, as the turns go on.&#10;&#10;There are 4 different type of tactical icons-
  Attack, Defence, Pass, and Press- and the action and the effect you may take in
  your turn vary according to the type and amount of the icons you have been made.&#10;Based
  on the tactical icons you have, you may 1) attempt a shot, 2) draw Synergy Cards,
  and 3) push the Control Maker on the Control Track.&#10;&#10;When you attempt a
  shot, compare your attack power and the opponent's defence power. Both of attack/defence
  power can be strengthened with the Synergy Cards that each player has. The Synergy
  Cards represent the teamwork and the passing play of the team. And if your Control
  is high enough, you may add more Synergy Cards to the attack power. If the total
  of the attack power is higher than the defence power, as a result, it's a goal!&#10;&#10;In
  case you made the total attack power exactly 11, it called a Magic Number, or Wonder
  Goal, so the opponent can't defend the shot even with the higher defence power.
  On the other hand, if it exceeds 11, it's always no goal bacause the shot was too
  strong to be on target. Since there is always at least ONE unknown Synergy Card
  which has to be played from deck, so you can't guarantee the outcome of the shot!&#10;&#10;A
  round ends when all the Synergy Cards run out. When the 2nd round ends, a team with
  higher score wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;
