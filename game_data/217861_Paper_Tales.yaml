description: Experience two fantastical centuries of expansions and combat in Paper
  Tales. Remodel your assorted assembly of characters, units, and buildings in each
  period based on your developments and the age of your heroes. Write a new legend
  of the rightful ruler who brought unity to the rival kingdoms.&#10;&#10;In more
  detail, Paper Tales is a simultaneous drafting card game. Each turn, players draft
  five units that they then recruit into their kingdom &mdash; assuming that they
  can pay. These choices determine the players ability to shine in battle, generate
  great income, construct dominant buildings, and earn legend points. There are only
  four hiring positions available during the four rounds of the play, but your units
  grow older with each turn until time takes them away.&#10;&#10;Build a comprehensive
  strategy and adapt the shape of your realm according  to opportunities and restrictions  and
  you will make history!&#10;&#10;
