description: In Three Star Zoo, you place animals in cages from 1 to 12, roll the
  dice, and if your animal is in the cage with the correct number of stars, you can
  get coins or take coins from other players depending on the effect. If you get coins,
  you can expand your zoo by placing new animals, and finally, the person who collects
  three &quot;stars,&quot; a sign of excellence, will win the &quot;three-star&quot;
  zoo.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;
