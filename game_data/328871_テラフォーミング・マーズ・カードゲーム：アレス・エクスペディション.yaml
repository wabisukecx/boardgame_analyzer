description: 'Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition is an engine-building game in which
  players control interplanetary corporations with the goal of making Mars habitable
  (and profitable). You will do this by investing mega credits (MC) into project cards
  that will directly or indirectly contribute to the terraforming process. In order
  to win, you will want to accumulate a high terraform rating (TR) and as many victory
  points (VP) as you can. Players raise their TR by increasing global parameters:
  oceans, oxygen, and temperature. TR also determines each corporation''s basic income,
  and, at the end of the game TR counts as VP. Additional VP and production capabilities
  are awarded for building project cards and other actions taken during the game.&#10;&#10;The
  game is played in rounds, and each round the players will choose one of five phases,
  which determines which activities will take place during that round. This means
  every round is different, but can consist of building new project cards, taking
  general and project-specific actions, producing income and resources (plants and
  heat), or researching to draw more project cards. Every player will take all the
  phases selected for the round, and will receive a special bonus during the phase
  that they selected. To speed up the game, within each phase, players can act simultaneously
  without waiting for each other!&#10;&#10;The game board has tracks for oxygen, temperature,
  and terraform rating, as well as a place for all of the ocean tiles that will be
  flipped over the course of the game. The game ends when there is enough oxygen to
  breath (14%), oceans enough to allow Earth-like weather (9), and the temperature
  is well above freezing (+8&deg;C). It will then be possible, if not comfortable,
  to live on the surface of Mars!&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most
  VP at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;'
