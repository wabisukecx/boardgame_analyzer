description: 'The great Pharaoh Mino has passed, and rule passes to his eldest son:
  Pharoah Mido. Displeased with the plain appearance of the pyramid in which his father
  was buried, Mido turns his attention to his own legacy. He wishes for his own resting
  place to better reflect his majesty and has decreed that 2-4 architects build pyramids
  encrusted with jewels: a pyramido. The architect who builds the most impressive
  pyramido will be appointed Vizier and enjoy wealth and power beyond imagination.&#10;&#10;Pyramido
  is a tile-placement game in which each stage of the pyramid creates connections
  between them. Players take turns choosing from the available dominoes to create
  their pyramid. To maximize their points, players must match the jewel icons on the
  dominoes and place their markers of the same colors to activate the scoring areas.
  Each choice of domino and its positioning has a significant impact since the previous
  stages influence the score throughout the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;'
