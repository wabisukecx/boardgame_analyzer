description: 'For the 2019 edition see The Castles of Burgundy.&#10;&#10;The game
  is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the
  role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they
  aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit
  silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players
  taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom
  which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts
  when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several
  regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game
  is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with
  the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning
  of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first
  in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the
  game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take
  their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any
  two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered
  depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging
  area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his
  player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice
  in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed
  settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4)
  take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition
  to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the
  game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers
  the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement
  tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the
  turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus
  victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The
  game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.  Victory points are awarded
  for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from
  certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player
  with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include basic and advanced
  versions.&#10;&#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;There is
  a separate BGG entry for the 2019 edition: The Castles of Burgundy.  The 2019 edition
  includes, alongside the base game, eight expansions, seven of which had already
  been released separately as promotional items and one new to the 2019 release.&#10;&#10;UPC
