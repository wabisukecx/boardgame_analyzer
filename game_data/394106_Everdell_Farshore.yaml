description: The Forever Sea is calling...&#10;&#10;The rugged coast north of Everdell
  Valley is a land brimming with adventure and mystery. Stalwart sailors search for
  bountiful islands and valuable treasures. Dutiful monks inhabit abbeys and scriptoriums,
  meticulously translating and illuminating. Hard-working folk gather resources and
  build their cities in unison with the ever-changing waves of the mighty ocean.&#10;&#10;Welcome
  to Everdell Farshore, a standalone game set in the country of Farshore. Through
  each season, you lead a crew of critter workers to build up a prosperous city and
  to explore the enchanting ocean beyond. You must plan your actions carefully in
  order to build and to sail, for only by adapting to the winds of change will you
  succeed.&#10;&#10;The wind is high. The sun is breaking the horizon. It is time
  to set sail for adventure!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
