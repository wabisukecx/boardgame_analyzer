description: In Little Town, you lead a team of architects and must dispatch workers
  to the town, collect resources and money, build buildings, and develop this little
  town.&#10;&#10;In the game, which lasts four rounds, you can acquire resources such
  as wood, stones, fish, and wheat from the surrounding squares by putting workers
  on the board, with three workers being placed each round. When you place a worker,
  you acquire the resources available in all eight surrounding spaces. You can build
  buildings by using these resources, and you &mdash; or any other player &mdash;
  can gain the effect of the building when place a worker next to it; if you place
  next to a building owned by another, however, you must pay them a coin before you
  can collect those resources.&#10;&#10;Players collect victory points by using the
  powers of buildings, by constructing buildings, and by achieving goals dealt to
  them at the beginning of the game. After four rounds, whoever has the most victory
  points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
