description: In Ready Set Bet, you and your friends head to the races for a day of
  cheering, jeering, and betting on your favorite horses, whose fates hang on every
  roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;Ready Set Bet is played over four rounds. Each round
  consists of a race followed by bet resolution. During each race, players freely
  place their bet tokens on the board while the race is going on. After each race,
  players win or lose money for each of their placed bet tokens, then receive a VIP
  Club Card to help them win more money in the following races. After four rounds,
  the player with the most money wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
