description: 'You''ve studied the footage, connected the dots, and gathered what meager
  evidence you could. You''re close &mdash; soon the whole world will know the truth
  behind the Cryptid. A group of like-minded cryptozoologists have come together to
  finally uncover the elusive creature, but the glory of discovery is too rich to
  share. Without giving away some of what you know you will never succeed in locating
  the beast, but reveal too much and your name will be long forgotten!&#10;&#10;Cryptid
  is a unique deduction game of honest misdirection in which players must try to uncover
  information about their opponents'' clues while throwing them off the scent of their
  own. Each player holds one piece of evidence to help them find the creature, and
  on their turn they can try to gain more information from their opponents. Be warned;
  give too much away and your opponents might beat you to the mysterious animal and
  claim the glory for themselves!&#10;&#10;The game includes a modular board, five
  clue books, and a deck of set-up cards with hundreds of possible set-ups across
  two difficulty levels. It is also supported by an entirely optional digital companion,
  allowing for faster game set-up and a near-infinite range of puzzles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
