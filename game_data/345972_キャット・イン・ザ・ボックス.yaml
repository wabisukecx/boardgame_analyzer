description: 'Cat in the Box: Deluxe Edition is the quintessential quantum trick-taking
  card game for 2 - 5 cool cats, where your card&rsquo;s color isn&rsquo;t defined
  until you play it! Hypothesize how many tricks you will win, and record your bid.
  Place tokens on the community research board as you play your hand, and connect
  large groups of tokens to score even more points. Plan your tricks carefully as
  you cannot claim the color of a card with the same number that has already been
  declared. Doing so would be pawsitively catastrophic as you have just created a
  paradox!&#10;&#10;New Deluxe Edition features:&#10;&#10;    Supports 2-5 players&#10;    High
  quality geekbits-style plastic tokens&#10;    Recessed player boards&#10;    Recessed
  Center Research board&#10;    Score pad&#10;    And a custom plastic insert to keep
  Cat in the Box: Deluxe Edition tidy!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;'
