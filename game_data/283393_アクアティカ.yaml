description: Aquatica  is a deep, but easy to learn family engine builder about underwater
  kingdoms.&#10;&#10;In the game you will become one of the mighty ocean kings, struggling
  to bring glory to his realm. To win the game, you need to capture and buy locations,
  recruit new characters, and complete goals; each of these actions gives you victory
  points at the end of the game. To do so, you need to play cards from your hand (each
  with a unique set of actions) and combine them. Don't think it's simple! With a
  good strategy during your turn, you can take up to ten actions in a row.&#10;&#10;You
  will encounter plenty of mysterious ocean creatures and take them to your hand.
  With their help you will explore the unknown locations and raise found resources
  from the ocean depths to your kingdom. Mechanically this is represented with the
  help of three-layered player board and the unique mechanism of card-rising.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
