description: 'The evil Lord Eradikus has all but conquered the galaxy and is now on
  a victory lap across the sector in his flagship, Eradikus Prime. He may rule with
  an iron grip, but his most prized artifacts are about to slip through his cyborg
  claws. You and your fellow thieves have challenged each other to sneak aboard his
  ship, hack your way into its command module, and steal from him.&#10;&#10;Along
  the way, you''ll recruit allies and snatch up extra loot. But one false step and
  &mdash; Clank! Careless noise draws the attention of Lord Eradikus. Hacking into
  his command module and stealing his artifacts increases his rage. You''d better
  hope your friends are louder than you are if you want to make it to an escape pod
  and get out alive...&#10;&#10;Clank! In! Space! is built on the same game system
  as Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure, with players building a personal deck of cards
  throughout the course of the game, with the cards allowing them to move through
  the spaceship, attack things, acquire new cards, and &mdash; oh yeah &mdash; make
  noise to attract Lord Eradikus and potentially seal their own doom.&#10;&#10;'
