description: 'Maracaibo, a strategy game for 1-4 players by Alexander Pfister, is
  set in the Caribbean during the 17th century. The players try to increase their
  influence in three nations in four rounds with a play time of 40 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;The
  players sail on a round course through the Caribbean, e.g., you have city tiles
  where you are able to perform various&nbsp;actions or deliver goods to. One special
  feature is an implemented quest mode over more and various tiles, which tells the
  player, who chase after it, a little story.&#10;&#10;As a player, you move with
  your ship around the course, managing it by using cards like in other games from
  Alexander Pfister.&#10;&#10;&#10;NOTE: The Spanish and Portuguese editions of Maracaibo
  contain La Armada mini-expansion packaged inside the base game''s box.&#10;&#10;'
