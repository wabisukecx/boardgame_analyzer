description: 'For generations, harvesting bamboo has brought prosperity to your home.
  Work, perseverance, balance and prayer have made a small town flourish that has
  grown at the expense of the cane fields. Today, various clans live in harmony with
  nature.&#10;&#10;In Bamboo, players take on the role of clans that grow bamboo and
  use the fruits of their labor to take care of their family and thus add happiness
  points. This is an action management and tile optimization game that is both accessible
  and deep. With a very careful setting, Bamboo is part of the Kemushi saga, to which
  Bitoku and Silk also belong.&#10;&#10;Bamboo games are made up of 4 years or rounds,
  which in turn are divided into 4 phases or seasons. On their turns, players will
  burn incense in temples to seek favor from the spirits, and use bamboo shoots to
  perform actions such as seeking balance, cooking, home improvement, or managing
  finances.&#10;&#10;Following the doctrines of the home balance discipline allows
  for better optimization of home tiles, making it a fundamental pillar for progressing
  through the game. To score balance tiles you must use the balance action and follow
  the pattern indicated on the tile, which always has something to do with the type
  of home tiles you get during the game. There are four classes of home tiles: decoration,
  garden, faith, or useful. Depending on how they place them on their board, players
  will earn happiness points.&#10;&#10;In addition to managing the household, players
  will need to prepare for when tough times come. To get through the winter, it will
  be necessary to feed the family members with the tea, rice or ramen that has been
  prepared and stored in the previous season. And all this without forgetting to honor
  spirits and ancestors in the temples. The player who has made the largest offering
  of incense in each sacred space will receive the favor of one of the seven spirits
  of the forest, as a token of thanks. Spirit tiles, in addition to helping players
  throughout the game, offer bonus points in the final phase based on the number of
  different spirits in each player''s play area.&#10;&#10;With accessible and easy-to-learn
  rules, Bamboo is a very versatile title that will fit into any shelves. However,
  behind its apparent simplicity lies great strategic depth, with plenty of options
  available to players. In addition, Bamboo has an advanced game mode on the back
  of the personal boards, which will give the games an extra level of demand. Harvest
  bamboo and find balance in your home to win the game. May the spirits be with you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
