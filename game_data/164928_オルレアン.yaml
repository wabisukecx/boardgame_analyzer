description: During the medieval goings-on around Orl&eacute;ans, you must assemble
  a following of farmers, merchants, knights, monks, etc. to gain supremacy through
  trade, construction and science in medieval France.&#10;&#10;In Orl&eacute;ans,
  you will recruit followers and put them to work to make use of their abilities.
  Farmers and Boatmen supply you with money and goods; Knights expand your scope of
  action and secure your mercantile expeditions; Craftsmen build trading stations
  and tools to facilitate work; Scholars make progress in science; Traders open up
  new locations for you to use your followers; and last but not least, it cannot hurt
  to get active in monasteries since with Monks on your side you are much less likely
  to fall prey to fate.&#10;&#10;You will always want to take more actions than possible,
  and there are many paths to victory. The challenge is to combine all elements as
  best as possible with regard to your strategy.&#10;&#10;
