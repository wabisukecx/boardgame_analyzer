description: 'Root is a game of adventure and war in which 2 to 4 (1 to 6 with the
  ''Riverfolk'' expansion) players battle for control of a vast wilderness. Like Vast:
  The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different
  victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric
  design has never been more accessible.&#10;&#10;The nefarious Marquise de Cat has
  seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the
  many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen
  its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist
  the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous
  woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance&rsquo;s hopes and dreams,
  these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled
  the woods.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling
  Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume
  their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate
  of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately
  take root.&#10;&#10;In Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between
  each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games
  invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
