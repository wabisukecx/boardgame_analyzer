description: 'People with different knowledge and languages met and united as a new
  tribe, creating a new language and developing civilization.&#10;&#10;Gibberers:
  Invention of Language and Civilization is an expert word game akin to field linguistics.
  In the game, players become primitive humans who meet aliens and create a new language
  that allows them to communicate. As the vocabulary grows and generations pass, the
  new language evolves like a tech tree.&#10;&#10;Gibberers includes short rules that
  allow for a 60-minute game and full &quot;expert&quot; rules that generate a 180-minute
  experience not like any other word games.&#10;&#10;'
