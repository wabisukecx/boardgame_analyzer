description: 'San Francisco, 1937: Your cargo plane flies through a portal in the
  sky, transporting you to a rugged landscape filled with bizarre creatures, scheming
  gods, and untold dangers. But can you find your way back before the portal closes?&#10;&#10;Sleeping
  Gods: Distant Skies is a standalone sequel set in the world of Sleeping Gods. As
  in the original game, you and your friends trek through a vast landscape as you
  read branching storylines and meet vivid characters, but in this game you interact
  with the atlas on a deeper level &mdash; camping, exploring, overcoming obstacles,
  and searching for lost relics. The new action system allows you even greater agency
  while you travel and explore.&#10;&#10;In addition to the exploration and quest
  system from the original game, Sleeping Gods: Distant Skies features a fresh spin
  on combat. Players now build a combat deck from which they draw a varied hand of
  cards to play, making each combat encounter a fresh and dynamic puzzle.&#10;&#10;Although
  Sleeping Gods: Distant Skies builds on story elements in the first game, you do
  not need to play Sleeping Gods to enjoy this sequel. The game features new characters
  and storylines, explaining concepts from the original game as you encounter them.&#10;&#10;Return
  to the world of Sleeping Gods and experience a thrilling tale that hinges on your
  choices in a truly open-world experience!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;'
