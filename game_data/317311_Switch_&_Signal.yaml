description: All Aboard! &mdash; The Cooperative Train Game&#10;&#10;You begin this
  cooperative, family-friendly train game by controlling just a few trains on the
  tracks. At first, it&rsquo;s easy to make them travel where you like. As more trains
  arrive, you have to plan and coordinate your train schedules. Is the signal green?
  Where is this train going? Oh no, the switch wasn&rsquo;t set! If your train heads
  off in the wrong direction, your goods won&rsquo;t arrive on time! Only by working
  together to schedule and move your trains efficiently, will you and your team of
  conductors be able to win the game.&#10;&#10;The two different gameboards, Central
  Europe and North America, each bring fun challenges to overcome. In this cooperative
  strategy train game work with your teammates to build a network of trains that run
  at different speeds to transport goods as efficiently as possible. It has simple
  rules that are easy to learn and allow you to jump right into the action. Switch
  &amp; Signal features a double-sided game board, city tile variants, and customizable
  difficulty levels.&#10;&#10;
