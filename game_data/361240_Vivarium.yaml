description: '1898, Siberia, the seismologist Edgar Vuntaf discovers a continent free
  of any human presence, sheltering a teeming life, in forms never encountered before!
  Unknown plants, colossal creatures... Faced with this shocking discovery, the world''s
  scientific elite, gathered in Paris for the Universal exposition, create the Vivarium
  Syndicate, and decide to send explorers into this new continent&#10;&#10;An efficient
  and tense card collection game, with a great artistic direction! Each turn players
  use dominoes to create coordinates that allow them to build their card collection.
  After 7 rounds, the player that has successfully completed their objectives and
  collected the greatest creatures wins the game.&#10;&#10;Cards are placed on the
  board. Each turn, players use pairs of dominoes to create coordinates and grab the
  corresponding card on the board. Among this grid of cards: fantastic creatures divided
  according to their species and biotopes, scientific objectives but also various
  equipment cards to facilitate the taking of future cards. After 7 rounds, the player
  that has successfully completed their objectives and collected the greatest creatures
  wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;'
