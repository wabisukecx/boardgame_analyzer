  scientific elite, gathered in Paris for the Universal exposition, create the Vivarium
  Syndicate, and decide to send explorers into this new continent&#10;&#10;An efficient
  and tense card collection game, with a great artistic direction! Each turn players

  equipment cards to facilitate the taking of future cards. After 7 rounds, the player
  that has successfully completed their objectives and collected the greatest creatures
