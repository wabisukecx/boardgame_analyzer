  scientific elite, gathered in Paris for the Universal exposition, create the Vivarium
  Syndicate, and decide to send explorers into this new continent&#10;&#10;An efficient
  and tense card collection game, with a great artistic direction! Each turn players
  use dominoes to create coordinates that allow them to build their card collection.

  collected the greatest creatures wins the game.&#10;&#10;Cards are placed on the
  board. Each turn, players use pairs of dominoes to create coordinates and grab the

  according to their species and biotopes, scientific objectives but also various
  equipment cards to facilitate the taking of future cards. After 7 rounds, the player
