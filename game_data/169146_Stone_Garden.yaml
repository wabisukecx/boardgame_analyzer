  which also translates as &quot;rock garden&quot; or &quot;Japanese rock garden&quot;),

  of sand and moss side by side on their respective garden boards. When meditating
  by one's garden, virtue points are earned that can be spent on favorite rocks to
  elevate the garden further. Through famous garden architects from history, special
