description: You lead a grand civilization at the height of its influence, but can
  you save it from collapse? In Empire's End, 2-4 players compete to keep calamity
  at bay. Empire's End marries the intuitive and elegant mechanism of reverse-bidding
  with engine-building, long-term planning, and strategic depth. The result is a game
  with a quick tempo, abundant tension, and multiple challenging paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Players
  begin with a civilization at the height of its power. Play proceeds through a series
  of phases, varying as you progress through the game. During the Disaster phase,
  players face a common threat such as famine, a flood, or barbarians. The player
  who ends the bidding must take the disaster, which devastates one of their territories.&#10;&#10;With
  each disaster that befalls an empire, its people grow in wisdom and resilience.
  In the style of the modern classic game No Thanks, resources bid by all players
  will end up in the hands of the player who ultimately takes the disaster card. That
  player also gains a new ability, an innovation that reflects their empire's ability
  to adapt in the face of challenging times.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players move along
  a progress track that dictates whether they will face a disaster or another type
  of phase. Players can gain new resources during Production phases, rebuild lost
  territories during Industry phases, and challenge one another during Military phases.
  At the end of the progress track, the game is concluded and the winner is the civilization
  with the greatest number of victory points. Intact territories contribute points,
  but innovations and military successes can provide alternative ways to win.&#10;&#10;
