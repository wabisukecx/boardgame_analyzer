description: In Herbaceous, herb collectors compete to grow and store the most valuable
  medley of herbs. Everyone starts with four containers, each of which allows a different
  grouping action:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Group herbs of same type&#10;     Group different
  types&#10;     Group pairs&#10;     Group any three types (same or different)&#10;&#10;&#10;On
  your turn, you draw a herb, then decide to either keep it in your personal collection
  or put in into the communal pile. If kept, the next card goes to the communal pile;
  if placed in the communal pile, the next card goes in your personal collection.&#10;&#10;At
  the start of your turn, you can decide to use a container. If so, you assemble cards
  from personal and communal spaces, group them, then turn them all over. You have
  then &quot;collected&quot; those and can't use the container again.&#10;&#10;At
  the end of the game, collectors determine the best collection as a combination of
  value from their collection, matching herbs, and herb sets.&#10;&#10;
