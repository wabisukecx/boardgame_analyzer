description: 'Designed by Stan Kordonskiy (Dice Hospital, Rurik, Lock Up), developed
  by Jonny Pac (Coloma, Sierra West, Lions of Lydia), solo mode by Drake Villareal
  (Solani, Spook Manor), and illustrated by The Mico (Raiders of the North Sea, Paladins
  of the West Kingdom, Valeria),  Endless Winter: Paleoamericans takes place in North
  America, around 10,000 BCE. Players guide the development of their tribes across
  several generations&mdash;from nomadic hunter-gatherers to prosperous tribal societies.
  Over the course of the game, tribes migrate and settle new lands, establish cultural
  traditions, hunt paleolithic megafauna, and build everlasting megalithic structures.&#10;&#10;Endless
  Winter is a euro-style game that combines worker placement and deck building in
  an innovative way. Each round, players send their tribe members to various action
  spaces, and pay for the actions by playing cards and spending resources. Tribe cards
  grant additional labor, while Culture cards provide a variety of unique effects.
  As an alternative, cards can be saved for an end-of-round Eclipse phase, where they
  are simultaneously revealed to determine the new player order, and trigger various
  bonus actions.&#10;&#10;The game features a novel blend of interwoven systems and
  mechanisms, such as multi-use cards, area influence, tile placement, and set collection.
  Plus, there are many viable paths to victory. After four brisk rounds, scores are
  tallied, and the tribe with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
