description: In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval
  Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control
  of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court
  and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After
  every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player
  with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select
  one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros
  you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A
  turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations
  to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how
  many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board
  (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros
  into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule
  in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the
  five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king
  to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The
  goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible
  during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes
  you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region
  is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point
  bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande
  and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;
