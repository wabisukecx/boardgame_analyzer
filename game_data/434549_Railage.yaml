description: In a new continent, you are the president of a railroad company and you
  are trying to expand your business. You will acquire land, build stations, and establish
  a large railway network connecting numerous cities.&#10;&#10;Railage is a roll and
  write game in which players use a pen to draw shapes and other objects on a map.
  During the game, each player draws a &#227;&#128;&#135; (station) in a City on the
  map. In the area where the &#227;&#128;&#135; are drawn, the player can draw dots
  (roadbeds) and Tracks. Your score is built by connecting many stations with your
  Tracks. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
