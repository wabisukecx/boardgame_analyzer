description: '&quot;Codes are a puzzle. A game, just like any other game.&quot;&#10;&#10;-
  Alan Turing in The Imitation Game.&#10;&#10;Turing Machine is a fascinating and
  competitive deduction game. It offers a unique experience of questioning a proto-computer
  that works without electricity or any sort of technology, paving the way for a new
  generation of deduction games.&#10;&#10;The Goal? Find the secret code before the
  other players, by cleverly questioning the machine. With Turing Machine, you&rsquo;ll
  use an analog computer with unique components made of never-before-seen perforated
  cards.&#10;The game offers more than seven million problems from simple to mind-staggeringly
  complex combinations, making the gameplay practically endless!&#10;&#10;Including
  the original competitive mode, you can combine your brain power as a team or try
  to beat the game itself while playing solo.&#10;&#10;Are you ready for an intense
  cerebral gaming experience?&#10;&#10;'
