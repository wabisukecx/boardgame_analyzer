description: 'The players take the roles of Mallorcan farmers, who strive to harvest
  as many of the island&lsquo;s tropical fruits: &#239;&#172;&#129;gs, almonds, olives,
  oranges, grapes, and lemons, as possible. The players deliver their harvested fruits
  to the island communities, which have constantly changing requirements during the
  course of the game. For these deliveries, the players receive victory points. In
  the end, the player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Note: Finca:
