description: Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century
  Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an
  industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following
  years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen
  was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high
  importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium
  alcoholic beverage in Europe.&#10;&#10;Players represent historic clans with unique
  abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course
  whisky!&#10;&#10;The game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three
  phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players' turns&#10;     Production phase&#10;     Round
  scoring&#10;&#10;&#10;1. Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions,
  from building, to upgrading, trading and exporting. When players run out of money,
  they pass and collect a passing bonus.&#10;&#10;2. In the production phase, each
  player collects basic resources, refined goods and cash from their production units
  built on the game map. Each production unit built makes income visible on the player
  mat. Refined goods require the respective basic resource.&#10;&#10;3. Players receive
  VPs depending on the scoring tile of the current round.&#10;&#10;The game comes
  with eight different clans, a modular board with 16 configurations, eight port bonuses
  and eight round scoring tiles.&#10;&#10;
