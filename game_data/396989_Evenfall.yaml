description: It's Evenfall, and the Clans of Magic are preparing for a new era. Evenfall
  is the time when the boundaries of reality collapse and the supernatural awakens.
  The World-Tree opens its glowing gateways to unknown distant regions. Send Witches
  from your clan to discover and control new Places of Power. Use them for arcane
  rituals and battle for the favor of the Powerstones. But there is only one seat
  on the Enchanted Throne! Do you have the skills to lead the world into a new era?&#10;&#10;Evenfall
  is a card-driven, engine-building game with both novel and familiar mechanisms for
  1 to 4 players. Manage your resources, execute your actions in an efficient order,
  and discover card and action synergies that generate victory points. The game ends
  after three rounds, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
