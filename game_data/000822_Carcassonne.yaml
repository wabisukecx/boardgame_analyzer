description: 'Carcassonne is a tile placement game in which the players draw and place
  a tile with a piece of southern French landscape represented on it. The tile might
  feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it
  must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that
  cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile,
  the player can then decide to place one of their meeples in one of the areas on
  it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk,
  or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points
  for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions
  like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should
  I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead,
  thus making it a harder for them to complete it and score points?&quot; Since players
  place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed
  quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game
  in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;'
