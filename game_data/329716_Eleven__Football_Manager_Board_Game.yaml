description: 'Eleven &mdash; the number of players you have on the pitch at any given
  time, with those players making all the difference between being the best team and
  the worst. But every team knows that to be the best in the league it takes a lot
  more than players; it also takes an incredible manager.&#10;&#10;Eleven: Football
  Manager Board Game is an economic strategy game set in a world of sport. Your task
  is to manage and grow your own football club over the course of a season. During
  the game, you hire staff members, including trainers, physical therapists, PR specialists,
  and directors. You acquire sponsors, expand the stadium infrastructure, and take
  care of your club''s position in social media. Among the many tasks on the list
  are transferring new players and choosing the right tactics for each of the upcoming
  matches.&#10;&#10;Eleven can be played multiplayer or solo. The solo mode includes
  six different scenarios that challenge players with different starting situations
  and goals for the season. In the beginning, the task is simple: You have to climb
  the steps of the football leagues and achieve the appropriate experience. You may
  have to manage the club in a crisis, and at other times you will have to rejuvenate
  a football team of players that are not so young anymore. You may also have to fight
  against time to try to complete the stadium before the deadline!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
