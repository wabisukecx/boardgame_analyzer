description: 'In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations,
  sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the
  temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable.
  In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the
  terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not
  only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure
  throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;As a player,
  you acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying
  them to your hand. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing
  your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they
  become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough.
  Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards and actually
  playing them. Standard Projects are always available to complement your hand of
  cards. Your basic income, as well as your basic score, are based on your Terraform
  Rating. However, your income is boosted by your production, and VPs are also gained
  from many other sources.&#10;&#10;You keep track of your production and resources
  on your player board.  The game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel,
  Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best
  places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for
  different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation
  and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2)
  Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase:
  Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming
  a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery
  tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using
  the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several
  laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources
  according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the
  three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their required
  levels, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Combine
  your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10;'
