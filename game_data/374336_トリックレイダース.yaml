description: Trick Raiders is a trick-taking game in which a player is dealt some
  cards as a traditional hand and some cards face up on the table which form both
  their bid and are the only cards which may be used to lead to tricks. Prior to the
  game commencing, players may add to, leave alone, or remove cards from this face
  up group.&#10;&#10;It is a must-follow trick-taking game with a fixed trump suit.&#10;&#10;Players
  may be eliminated from a hand if it is their turn to lead to a trick and they are
  out of leading cards or if they need to follow and are out of cards in their hand.
  Players begin the game with a few life chips and the player with the most remaining
  when one person is out is the winner.&#10;&#10;A few ranks also have special abilities,
  for instance, when the 8 or 9 of clubs is played and wins a trick, the trump suit
  changes.&#10;&#10;
