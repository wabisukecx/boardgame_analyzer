description: In Hickory Dickory, players control a team of mice competing in a royal
  scavenger hunt hosted by Lord Cuckoo! The mice will ride on a cuckoo clock's minute
  hand as they search for items that match their hunt card. The adorable mice will
  jump off the hand to collect item tiles and perform various actions that will help
  them gain berries, a.k.a., victory points.&#10;&#10;Once the clock strikes midnight,
  the hunt is over and the mice will show off their scavenger hunt cards to Lord Cuckoo.
  Berries will be rewarded for rows and columns completed on their hunt card, and
  the mice team with the most berries wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;
