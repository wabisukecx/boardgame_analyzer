description: Age of Innovation is a standalone game set in the world of Terra Mystica.&#10;&#10;Twelve
  factions, each with unique characteristics, populate this world of varying terrains.
  Here you will compete to erect buildings and merge them into cities. Each game allows
  you to create new combinations of factions, homelands, and abilities so that each
  game isn't the same as another.&#10;&#10;You control one of these factions and will
  terraform the game map's terrain into your homelands where you can erect your buildings.
  Proximity to other factions may limit your expansion, but it also gains you significant
  advantages in the game. This tension adds to the appeal of the Terra Mystica series.&#10;&#10;Upgrade
  your buildings to gain valuable resources such as tools, scholars, money, and power.
  Build schools to advance in different sciences and collect books, which you can
  use to make innovations. Build your palace to gain a powerful new ability or build
  workshops, guilds, and universities to complete your culture.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
