description: 'Fantasic Age is a dice-manipulation fantasy adventure game where the
  goal is to earn as much fame as possible during the adventurers entire lifespan.&#10;&#10;Players
  start out as young adventurers, and go through adult and elderly age. Each turn,
  the players choose skills to improve their character, and choose a dungeon on the
  map to try to conquer. Each encounter is represented by a card, and solving all
  the encounters in the dungeon allows the player to encounter a boss.&#10;&#10;As
  adults, players get to build a House on the map, and as Elderly, they get to enter
  a Clan, both of which largely enhance the player''s abilities to earn fame. Player
  skills revolve around dice manipulation: changing die results, getting extra results
  for certain rolls, or adding dice. Players also have a Class that influences their
  chances in the dungeons in various ways.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played solo,
  aiming for a certain fame score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;'
