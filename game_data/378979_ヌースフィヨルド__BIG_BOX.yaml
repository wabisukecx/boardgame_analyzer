description: Nusfjord is a tranquil fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in
  northern Norway. Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come
  for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than
  a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that
  you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this
  long and now mostly abandoned island world.&#10;&#10;In the time period in which
  the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate
  the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major
  fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop
  the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet,
  clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this
  as well, of course, so the competition is steep.&#10;&#10;As with Agricola and Ora
  et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting
  with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions.
  Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or
  construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space &mdash;
  which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and
  one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company
  on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying
  these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages;
  however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit
  from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share
  of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions
  in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the
  hands of others and your camp will be empty.&#10;&#10;Nusfjord Big Box contains
  the Nusfjord base game, two previously released expansions (Plaice deck and Salmon
  deck), and two new expansions (Trout deck and Besoekende deck), along with extra
  components, among them new guest meeples.&#10;&#10;
