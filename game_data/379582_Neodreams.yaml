description: In the near future, an astonishing new technology has been developed
  that allows the sleeping mind and machine to be connected. It is called Oneiroshunt,
  and with it, the business of crafting and selling dreams has become a thriving industry.
  For the right price, clients can learn new skills, overcome deep-seated fears, and
  travel to the most extraordinary locations all from the comfort of their beds.&#10;&#10;In
  Neodreams, each player is the CEO of a company that is developing and using this
  technology, and they must expand fast to keep up with the competition. In this economic
  strategy game, players will deploy their Oneironauts to gather resources, craft
  stunning experiences, improve dreamscapes, and gain clients. The player who accumulates
  the most wealth once enough dreams have been created will dominate the Oneiroshunt
  industry for years to come!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
