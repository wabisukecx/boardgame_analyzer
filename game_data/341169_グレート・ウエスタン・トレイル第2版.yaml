description: 'America in the 19th century: You are a rancher and repeatedly herd your
  cattle from Texas to Kansas City, where you send them off by train. This earns you
  money and victory points. Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City,
  you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However, the &quot;Great Western
  Trail&quot; not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that
  you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea
  to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very
  own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.&#10;&#10;If you cleverly
  manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail,
  you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;The second
  edition of Great Western Trail includes solitaire rules, making for a player count
  of 1-4.&#10;&#10;Second Edition:&#10;Remember the old days in the West? Well, the
  times they are a-changing&rsquo;! From new solo opponent to incredible landscapes,
  you won''t know where to start. And there is a new herd of cows for you to sell!&#10;&#10;Great
  Western Trail is the critically acclaimed game of cattle ranching by Alexander Pfister.
  Players attempt to wrangle their herd across the Midwest prairie and deliver it
  to Kansas City. But beware! Other cowboys are sharing the trail with you. We invite
  you to saddle up!&#10;&#10;The changes in the Second edition:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Brand
