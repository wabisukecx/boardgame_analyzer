description: In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score
  as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number
  cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to
  each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their
  hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order
  based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with
  the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed
  in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card
  becomes the first card in its row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104,
  each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score
  and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater
  than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens,
  the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players,
  and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant
  for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104
  cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. players. This change allows you to
  know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been
  played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;
