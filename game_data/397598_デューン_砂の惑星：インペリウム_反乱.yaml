description: 'In Dune: Imperium Uprising, you want to continue to balance military
  might with political intrigue, wielding new tools in pursuit of victory. Spies will
  shore up your plans, vital contracts will expand your resources, or you can learn
  the ways of the Fremen and ride mighty sandworms into battle!&#10;&#10;Dune: Imperium
  Uprising is a standalone spinoff to Dune: Imperium that expands on that game''s
  blend of deck-building and worker placement, while introducing a new six-player
  mode that pits two teams against one other in the biggest struggle yet.&#10;&#10;The
  Dune: Imperium expansions Rise of Ix and Immortality work with Uprising, as do almost
  all of the cards from the base game, and elements of Uprising can be used with Dune:
  Imperium.&#10;&#10;The choices are yours. The Imperium awaits!&#10;&#10;'
