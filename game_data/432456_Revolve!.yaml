description: Your goal in Revolve! is to empty your hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Each player
  starts with eight or ten cards in hand, with each card having different numbers
  (from 1-10) at top and bottom, e.g. 1 and 7. Pick up all your cards at once; you
  can rearrange cards from left to right at any time, but you can't revolve them.
  On a turn, first discard any cards on the table in front of you, then you can:&#10;&#10;1.
  Play cards from your hand.&#10;2. Add one card to the table.&#10;3. Take cards from
  the table.&#10;4. Revolve all cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;When you play cards,
  you can play one or more cards of the same value &mdash; but if you play as many
  cards as another player has in front of them, your cards must be of higher value.
  If you overplay someone, e.g. playing two 5s when they have two 2s, they must revolve
  their cards, then return them to their hand.&#10;&#10;When you add one card, you
  add a card of the same value to someone else's played cards &mdash; but if that
  player would now have the same number of cards as a third player, the third player's
  cards must be a lower value, in which case they revolve them and return them to
  hand.&#10;&#10;When you pick up cards from in front of another player, revolve them,
  then add them to your hand.&#10;&#10;The first player to empty their hand scores
  2 points, and cards don't return to their hand, even if beaten. The second player
  to empty their hand scores 1 point. Play multiple rounds until someone has at least
  4 points, then whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;
