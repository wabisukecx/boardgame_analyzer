description: 'In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant
  force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities and roads. On each
  turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build
  structures by ''spending'' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are
  represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of
  the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests
  produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce
  sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting
  one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb
  shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange.
  A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice,
  are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses)
  and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain
  tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their
  last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A
  turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice
  roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning
  in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a
  port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other
  players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain
  tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent
  to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities,
  having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards),
  and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a
  player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces
  this and claims the win.&#10;&#10;'
