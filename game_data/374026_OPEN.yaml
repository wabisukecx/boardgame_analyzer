description: OPEN is a climbing and shedding game in which each person plays with
  four of their six cards face up on the table.&#10;&#10;At the start of each hand,
  players make a secret bet on which player they think will play all of their cards
  first.  Points are awarded to all players but the last to go out. Points are also
  awarded to players who accurately predicted who would go out first.&#10;&#10;Rounds
  are played until one player reaches a given score, then the player with the most
  points wins.&#10;&#10;
