description: Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are
  merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops&mdash;all
  in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might
  even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase
  your prestige.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy
  and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either
  three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card,
  you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card&mdash;in
  order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it&mdash;you
  place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but
  you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.&#10;&#10;All
  of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus
  for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win
  the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.&#10;&#10;
