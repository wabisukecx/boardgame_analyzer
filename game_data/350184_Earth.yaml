description: Earth is a tableau builder with simple rules and countless strategic
  possibilities. With its encyclopedic nature and a near-infinite number of tableau
  combinations, every single game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections,
  just as our vast and fascinating world allows us to do!&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s time
  to jump into these rich environments and create some amazing natural synergies that
  replicate and extrapolate on Earth&rsquo;s amazing versatility and plethora of natural
  resources.  Over thousands of years of evolution and adaptation the flora and fauna
  of this unique planet have grown and developed into amazing life forms, creating
  symbiotic ecosystems and habitats.&#10;&#10;Players create a self-supporting engine
  of growth, expansion and supply where even your unused plants become compost for
  future growth. They use their cards to choose actions (which affect all players)
  and gain resources. The first player to complete their Tableau triggers the end
  of the game. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from
