description: In this fast-playing riff on Talisman, you play valkyries fighting your
  way from Midgard through Niflheim to Hvergelmir to hold back the dragon Nidhogg
  from starting Ragnarok.&#10;&#10;Defeat enemies by beating their strength with a
  roll of the dice, but score more points by using fewer dice to do so. Enlist the
  souls of dead warriors from Valhalla to gain dice manipulation abilities, but too
  many warriors in your band will penalize your score.&#10;&#10;Defeated cards in
  the board's grid give you bonus dice against other cards in their row and column,
  so plan ahead and choose your path to the center carefully.&#10;&#10;
