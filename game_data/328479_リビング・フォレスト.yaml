description: 'In Living Forest, you play as a nature spirit who will try to save the
  forest and its sacred tree from the flames of Onibi. But you are not alone in your
  mission as the animal guardians have come together to lend a hand around the Circle
  of Spirits where you progress. Each turn, they bring you valuable elements, so try
  to combine your team of animal guardians as best as possible to carry out your actions,
  but be careful: some of them are solitary and do not like to be mixed with others...&#10;&#10;You
  have one of three ways to achieve your goal: by planting 12 different Protective
  Trees, by collecting 12 Sacred Flowers to awaken Sanki the great Guardian of the
  Forest, by extinguishing 12 Fires to permanently repel Onibi.&#10;&#10;Each turn
  includes 3 phases: &#10;&bull; Guardian Animals (simultaneous push your luck phase)
  : You draw and turn face up, one after the other, the Guardian Animal cards from
  your personal stack. You thus form the Animal Guardian Help Line. You can stop drawing
  cards whenever you want. However, if you reveal a card showing a third solitary
  symbol, then you must stop drawing cards. This card closes your Help Line.&#10;&bull;
  Action phase: You play in turn. If your Help Line shows strictly less than three
  solitary symbols (not canceled by gregarious symbols), you can then perform 2 different
  Actions. If your Help Line shows three solitary symbols (not canceled by gregarious
  symbols), you can then perform only 1 Action. The strength of an Action is determined
  by the number of corresponding Elements visible on the Guardian Animal cards in
  your Help Line and on your Forest individual board.&#10;&bull; End of the turn:&#10;-
  Onibi attacks you: If some Fires remain at the center of the Circle of Spirits and
  you cannot resist them, then add as many Fire Varan cards to your discard stack
  as there are Fire tiles at the center of the Circle of Spirits.&#10;- Onibi attacks
  the Sacred Tree: Add as many Fires to the center of the Circle of Spirits as there
  are Guardian Animal cards taken this turn.&#10;- The arrival of new Guardian Animals:
  Complete the Guardian Animal reserve by revealing as many new cards per level as
  there were cards taken this turn.&#10;- Passing the Sacred Tree: Give the Sacred
  Tree to the next Spirit of Nature clockwise.&#10;- The Return of Guardian Animals:
  Move all the Animal Guardian cards from your Help Line to your personal discard
  stack.&#10;&#10;The game stops at the end of a complete turn when one of the Spirits
  of Nature has managed to collect at least 12 different Protective Trees OR 12 Fires
  OR 12 Sacred Flowers.&#10;&#10;'
