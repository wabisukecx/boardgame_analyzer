description: '&quot;My Trolley Town&quot; is a tile placement game for 1-4 players,
  with a play time of about 45 minutes.&#10;Players produce resources, construct buildings
  and tracks, transport and process resources to get victory points.&#10;&#10;In this
  game, each player starts with only a &quot;forest&quot; and a &quot;mountain&quot;
  and builds his or her own factory city over four rounds.&#10;&#10;Each round has
  four phases: &quot;Production&quot;, &quot;Construction&quot;, &quot;Transportation&quot;
  and &quot;Processing&quot;.&#10; In the Production phase, each player activates
  the production effects of all buildings he owns.&#10;In the Construction phase,
  each player takes a turn, beginning with the starting player. The active player
  chooses one of the following three actions:&#10;- Build a building&#10;- Build or
  upgrade any number of tracks&#10;- Pass&#10;During the Transportation Phase, each
  player may move as many resources as he wishes along the tracks on his tile.&#10;In
  the Processing phase, each player activates the processing effects of all the buildings
  he owns as many times as possible.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who scores
  the highest victory points.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;'
