description: In Evergreen, your goal is to build a lush ecosystem by planting seeds,
  growing trees, and placing other natural elements on your planet, trying to make
  it the greenest and most fertile of all.&#10;&#10;You choose biome cards from a
  common pool to determine which area of your planet you'll develop in a round. The
  cards not chosen make those regions more fertile, and thus more valuable. To create
  a huge forest, you want to grow trees, plant bushes, and place lakes, while using
  the power of nature to gain extra actions. Ideally you can concentrate your trees
  in the most fertile areas, but without them overshadowing one another as you also
  want them to collect as much light as possible.&#10;&#10;
