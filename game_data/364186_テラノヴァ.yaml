description: Terra Nova is a simplified version of the strategy game Terra Mystica.
  In the game, up to four players each control one of ten factions, each with different
  abilities. Compete against one another to explore new territories in peaceful competition,
  erect buildings, and achieve certain goals from round to round. Use your faction's
  special abilities in a clever way to control the largest territory at game's end
  and finish with the most points.&#10;&#10;
