description: 'In Rats of Wistar, you play the role of one of the four rats who organized
  the escape from a lab. As such, you will have to lead your family to prove that
  you are the most deserving of leading the entire colony. Thanks to your extraordinary
  skills, you will be able to explore the Farm until you reach the pantry to be able
  to grab the appetizing cheese; exploiting the artifacts abandoned by humans at the
  edge of the Wood, you will create new inventions and expand your lair under the
  trees, digging new rooms and building new beds. You will meet native rats and mice
  that you will welcome into your family, and when necessary, you will visit the Alchemist
  mouse to gain some extra advantage.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over 5 rounds
  (equal to the 5 days in which the challenge takes place) and you will earn victory
  points (VPs) as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     build beds,&#10;     excavation rooms,&#10;     by
  solving missions within the Farm,&#10;     welcome host mice,&#10;     build new
  Inventions,&#10;     claim Achievements.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the
  player with the most VPs wins. In case of a tie, the player furthest in the turn
  order wins.&#10;&#10;Note: Rats of Wistar is not affiliated, associated, authorized,
