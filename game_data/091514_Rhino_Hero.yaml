description: Super Rhino! presents players with an incredibly heroic &ndash; and regrettably
  heavy &ndash; rhinoceros who is eager to climb a tall building and leap other tall
  buildings in a single bound. First, though, you need to construct that building.&#10;&#10;Players
  each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs
  to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then
  you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears
  markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition,
  some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second
  roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on
  the tower. Keep your hands steady!&#10;&#10;The first player to build all of their
  roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who
  caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards
  in hand wins.&#10;&#10;Similar to Turmbau zu Babel&#10;&#10;
