description: 'Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game
  Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original
  edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil
  Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.&#10;&#10;The
  objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone''s
  network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing
  routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase
  the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants
  are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing,
  you''re potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally,
  players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed
  to power said plants (except for the ''renewable'' windfarm/ solar plants, which
  require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum
  efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to
  get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#152;&#155; Power Grid FAQ - Please read
  this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in
  the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the
  rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion.&#10;&#10;'
