  Zone of the world's seas and oceans. In Finspan, the fish you discover over four
  weeks will generate a series of benefits as you dive deeper into the ocean.&#10;&#10;Each
  dive site specializes in a key aspect of expanding your research:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Grow
  your collection of fish.&#10;     Discover freshly laid eggs.&#10;     Hatch eggs
  into young and consolidate young to form schools.&#10;&#10;&#10;The winner is the
