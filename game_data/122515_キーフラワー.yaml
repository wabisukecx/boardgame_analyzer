description: 'Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds.
  Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each
  player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight
  workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors
  are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers
  may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers,
  not only from the player''s own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players''
  villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and
  autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with
  some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron,
  stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for
  auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village
  tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter
  village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers.
  The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keyflower
  presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different
  due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout
  the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their
  various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&#10;&#10;Keyflower,
  a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game
  in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot;
  land.&#10;&#10;'
