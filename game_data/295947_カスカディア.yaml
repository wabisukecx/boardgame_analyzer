description: Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the
  habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.&#10;&#10;In the game, you take turns
  building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife. You start with
  three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and
  on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then
  place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate
  habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game,
  and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with
  each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best
  of what's available &mdash; unless you have a nature token to spend so that you
  can pick your choice of each item.&#10;&#10;Ideally you can place habitat tiles
  to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors,
  mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game's
  end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player's. At the same
  time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points
  scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the
  four scoring cards for each type of wildlife. Maybe hawks want to be separate from
  other hawks, while foxes want lots of different animals surrounding them and bears
  want to be in pairs. Can you make it happen?&#10;&#10;
