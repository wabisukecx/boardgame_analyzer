description: 'In It&rsquo;s a Wonderful World, you are an expanding Empire and must
  choose your path to your future. You must develop faster and better than your competitors.
  You&rsquo;ll carefully plan your expansion to develop your production power and
  rule over this new world.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a Wonderful World is a cards drafting
  and engine building game from 1 to 5 players. Each round, players will draft 7 cards
  and then choose which ones will be recycled to immediately acquire Resources, and
  which ones will be kept for construction to produce Resources each round and/or
  gain victory points.&#10;&#10;When a card is fully built, it&rsquo;s added to the
  player&rsquo;s Empire to increase the player&rsquo;s production capacity for each
  round. The mechanical twist being that the production phase works in a specific
  order. You''ll have to plan your constructions carefully!&#10;&#10;For a deeper
  insight of the gameplay, please follow this link : It''s a Wonderful World - First
  steps&#10;&#10;In addition to the base game, players can also enjoy expansions boxes
  introducing an innovative Campaign mode. Each Campaign offers a storyline to follow
  and many gameplay twists. At the end of each campaign, players will open a reward
  booster to unlock new cards, enhance their base game and keep a memory of what happened
  during the campaign. All the campaigns can be replayed and don&rsquo;t imply game
  components destruction.&#10;&#10;More info on the Campaign mode : It''s a Wonderful
