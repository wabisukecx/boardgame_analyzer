description: In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously
  all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is
  to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before
  they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers
  on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities,
  treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of
  cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck
  are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second,
  separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking
  a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their
  specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations
  Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases
  and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four
  cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the
  diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases
  spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they
  cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes
  two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not
  available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Pandemic is the first game in
  the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;
