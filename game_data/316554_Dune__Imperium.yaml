description: 'Dune: Imperium is a game that uses deck building to add a hidden information
  angle to traditional worker placement. It finds inspiration in elements and characters
  from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal
  literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.&#10;&#10;As
  a leader of one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad, raise your banner and marshal
  your forces and spies. War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis
  &ndash; Dune, the desert planet.&#10;&#10;You start with a unique leader card, as
  well as a deck identical to those of your opponents.  As you acquire cards and build
  your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you
  to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves
  affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy
  more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge
  with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing
  Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.&#10;&#10;Unlike many deck building games,
  you don&rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards
  at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn
  at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When
  it&rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you&rsquo;ll take a Reveal
  turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords.
  Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for
  the current round&rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.&#10;&#10;Defeat
  your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious
  cards. The Spice must flow to lead your House to victory!&#10;&#10;Some important
