description: 'This Extended Edition includes Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory
  base game + Crisis &amp; Control expansion.&#10;&#10;&#10;Put another way, the Crisis
  &amp; Control &quot;expansion&quot; includes the components from the Kickstarter
  edition that were omitted from the retail edition. This Extended Edition is the
  Kickstarter Edition:&#10;&#10;&#10;    570 Cards (325 in regular edition + 245 from
  Crisis &amp; Control)&#10;    248 Cardboard tokens (222 + 26)&#10;    2 rule books
  (1 + 1)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory base game&#10;&#10;The
  Nation is in disarray and a war is waging between the classes. The working class
  faces a dismantled welfare system, the capitalists are losing their hard-earned
  profits, the middle class is gradually fading and the state is sinking into a deep
  deficit. Amidst all this chaos, the only person who can provide guidance is... you.
  Will you take the side of the working class and fight for social reforms? Or will
  you stand with the corporations and the free market? Will you help the government
  try to keep it all together, or will you try to enforce your agenda no matter the
  cost to the country?&#10;&#10;Hegemony is an asymmetric politico-economic card-driven
  board game for 2-4 players that puts you in the role of one of the socio-economic
  groups in a fictional state: The Working Class, the Middle Class, the Capitalist
  Class and the State itself.&#10;&#10;The Working class controls the workers. The
  Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from
  both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist''s
  companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State
  is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but
  trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.&#10;&#10;While
  players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies
  that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc.
  Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important.
  Through careful planning, strategic actions and political maneuvering, you will
  do your best to increase the power of your class and carry out your agenda. Will
  you be the one to lead your class to victory?&#10;&#10;Hegemony is heavily based
  on actual academic principles such as Social-Democracy, Neoliberalism, Nationalism
  and Globalism, and allows players to see their real world applications through engaging
  gameplay. There are many ways to achieve hegemony- which one will you take?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
  from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Crisis &amp; Control&#10;&#10;You have successfully
  led your class to victory... but the battle of ideologies is far from over! The
  old world is in crisis, and the new world struggles to regain control. Now is the
  time to make a difference!&#10;&#10;Crisis &amp; Control offers new challenges and
  additional game modes that will test your governance skills like never before! Crisis
  Response cards and Alternative Events add more diversity to your games, class-specific
  Hidden Agendas incentivize new politico-economic strategies, and the Automas provided
  allow you to experience all of the game&rsquo;s roles, no matter the player count!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
  from the rulebook&#10;&#10;Crisis &amp; Control contains all the gameplay material
  that was given in the form of stretch goals during Hegemony''s Kickstarter campaign.
  All that content was included in the Extended Edition of Hegemony which is what
  the campaign''s backers received.&#10;&#10;'
