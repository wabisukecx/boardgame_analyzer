description: When Elsa von Fr&uuml;hlingsfeld presented her invention to King Frederik
  Augustus II of Saxony, people thought it was trickery. She used the recently isolated
  element Uranium to heat up a jar of water and used the resulting steam to power
  an engine that kept the Uranium active via a process she called &ldquo;atomization.&rdquo;
  Her device, the Nucleum, ushered in a new era of energy and prosperity over the
  next decades. Saxony went from a minor regional power to the hub of European science
  and engineering. Now, a generation later, factories are still hungry for more power,
  demanding bigger and more Nucleums to be built, more Uranium imported from the nearby
  country of Bohemia, and railways and power lines built across the country to carry
  the tamed power of the atoms to Saxony&rsquo;s great cities. Inventors, engineers,
  and industrialists flock to the Saxon court, vying to be the leader in this new
  industrial revolution.&#10;&#10;Nucleum is a heavy euro board game in which players
  take role of industrialists trying to succeed during the economic and technological
  boom of 19th-century Saxony, fueled by the invention and spread of the Nucleum (a
  nuclear reactor).&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points by developing their networks,
  building and powering urban buildings, securing contracts, and meeting milestones
  (randomized endgame goals). Each player also gets unique asymmetric technologies,
  giving them special powers when unlocked. Gameplay is continuous; players take turns
  one after another with no rounds or phases.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the
