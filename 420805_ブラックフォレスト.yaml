description: In Black Forest, you start out with a small domain in need of new buildings
  and livestock. You&rsquo;ll travel from village to village, to enlist the aid of
  the best specialists.  Exploiting the abilities of these specialists lets you collect
  resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g. ponds and fields), and build a variety
  of buildings, which come in four types. Choose the right buildings, place landscapes,
  fire up your glass production, and expand your domain.&#10;&#10;Uwe Rosenberg&rsquo;s
  resource wheels, made famous in Glass Road (2013), return in Black Forest. Two resource
  wheels on your tableau help you keep track of your resources and production. Black
  Forest continues the story - as the name suggests &mdash; in the Black Forest. Among
  others, the main difference between the two games is the use of worker placement
  in Black Forest  instead of simultaneous action selection.&#10;&#10;A wide selection
  of buildings and their different effects offer many different paths to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description
