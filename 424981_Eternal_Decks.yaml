description: Eternal Decks is a co-operative game in which players try to complete
  the stage objectives before any one player cannot take an action. Players start
  the game with five cards in their deck, but will quickly look to acquire more cards
  from the various Eternals (characters within the game) who each have their own unique
  eight-card deck. On your turn, you must perform one action:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Play
  a card (on the field, on the river, or by using an ability)&#10;     Generate a
  jewel&#10;     Give a card to a teammate&#10;&#10;&#10;There are restrictions when
  playing a card. All three rows in the field cannot have cards of the same color
  or same number next to each other. Additional restrictions are applied to a row
  based on the stage you are playing. Jewels are used to negate the negative effects
  brought on by the Eternals.&#10;&#10;The game has six stages, and the various stages
  will have you collect points, survive a ghost town, navigate a labyrinth, defeat
  a boss, and more to win the game!&#10;&#10;
