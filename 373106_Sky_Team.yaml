description: Sky Team is a co-operative game, exclusively for two players, in which
  you play a pilot and co-pilot at the controls of an airliner. Your goal is to work
  together as a team to land your airplane in different airports around the world.&#10;&#10;To
  land your plane, you need to silently assign your dice to the correct spaces in
  your cockpit to balance the axis of your plane, control its speed, deploy the flaps,
  extend the landing gear, contact the control tower to clear your path, and even
  have a little coffee to improve your concentration enough to change the value of
  your dice.&#10;&#10;If the aircraft tilts too much and stalls, overshoots the airport,
  or collides with another aircraft, you lose the game...and your pilot's license...and
  probably your life.&#10;&#10;From Montreal to Tokyo, each airport offers its own
  set of challenges. Watch out for the turbulence as this could end up being a bumpy
  ride!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
