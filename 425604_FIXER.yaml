description: In this competitive trick taker, players utilize the four suits to become
  the ultimate shadow ruler. The regime controls the capital, the capital controls
  the media, the media controls the people, the people overthrow the regime&hellip;&#10;&#10;Each
  suit features one weak and one strong match-up. Players take turns placing cards
  into areas. Players must follow suit in an arena if able. As soon as an area has
  two cards, conflict resolution occurs!&#10;&#10;The winner gets one of the three
  victory point tokens and takes their opponent's card as points. However, the losing
  player can choose to take the stronger card into their hand!&#10;&#10;Once no victory
  point tokens remain, the game is over!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
